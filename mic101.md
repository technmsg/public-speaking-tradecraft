### Stay on the stage

Note: At the Cloudera Federal Forum, the Director of DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency) [started walking around]((https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/16456582598/)) (CC BY-NC 2.0). As a result, most of the audience couldn't see him and he likely didn't appear on the recording. <!-- SRC:lighting^https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16456582598_9437d1d183_b.jpg -->



## Inclusion


### Look at your audience
Note: Pan the room. Slowly. Not head on swivel.


### Repeat all questions
Note: Moreso if video. Remote employees.


### Yes, you need a mic
Note: Don’t poll your audience, asking if they can hear you.
